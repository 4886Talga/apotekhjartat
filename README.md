## Prerequisites

## The problem

There‚Äôs a `prescriptions.json` file attached next to these instructions that you are expected
to use in these ways:
‚Ä¢ Show a list with prescriptions with data from the json file
‚Ä¢ In every row, you should at least show the article productName and preamble
‚Ä¢ Every row with items that aren‚Äôt in stock should have a red background
‚Ä¢ Items in the list should be clickable and take you to a view with more details
‚Ä¢ In the details view, the info about the prescriber should be visible.
Feel free to expand with more functionality as you see fit.
How much time you spend on different aspects like reusability, testing, error handling, UX
or nice graphics is up to you. As you may not have time for everything, make sure you can
motivate what you spend time on.
